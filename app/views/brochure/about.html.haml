    h1. Hi there, neighbor!
    
    We've all got plenty of stuff we're not using _all_ the time, and within neighborhoods, there's a huge amount of redundancy.  This is a ridiculously inefficient system.  We can do better.
  
    How often have you needed to out and buy that one thing necessary to finish  some project?  Maybe it was a bundt pan or a hole cutter or a reference textbook.  You used it a handful of times,  and now it sits in your cabinet or on a shelf, begging to be put to better use.
  
    Or maybe you like to invest in tools.  You never know when you're going to need a particular tool, which is why you've built yourself a nice toolbox (or shop, or kitchen, etc). Maybe you have every gauge of knitting needle that ever knitted a row.
  
    Wouldn't it feel great to put those resources to use helping people in your neighborhood?  Sure, friends and acquaintances know to ask, but how many anonymous neighbors go out and buy something identical to an item gathering dust in your cupboard.  When you don't know who has what, it's prohibitively awkward to go knocking on doors to ask to borrow a 3"x9" springform pan or a copper bowl.
  
    h2. Here's how ShareLocally solves these problems:
  
    # You list the things that you are willing to share (lend), how long you're willing to share them, and where you are.
    # Nobody can see your list of items or even that you're on ShareLocally.
    # When people search for the item, *they do not see your name or address*, just the item.  If they're interested, they send a request to you for your item, allowing you to see their profile and lending/borrowing history.
    # ShareLocally provides a proxy email address for every user, allowing for anonymous information requests to make the lender more comfortable with the loan request.  None of the lender's information is shared automatically.
    # If request seem trustworthy and worthwhile, you can approve their request and contact them through the email proxy system to arrange pick up or get more details.
